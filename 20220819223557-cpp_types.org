* Integer Types
| type               | signed | 32-bit | 64-Linux/Mac | 64-Windows | printf |
|--------------------+--------+--------+--------------+------------+--------|
| short              | yes    |      2 |            2 |          2 | %hd    |
| unsigned short     | no     |      2 |            2 |          2 | %hu    |
| int                | yes    |      4 |            4 |          4 | %d     |
| unsigned int       | no     |      4 |            4 |          4 | %u     |
| long               | yes    |      4 |            8 |          4 | %ld    |
| unsigned long      | no     |      4 |            8 |          4 | %lu    |
| long long          | yes    |      8 |            8 |          8 | &lld   |
| unsigned long long | no     |      8 |            8 |          8 | %llu   |

Note that the different integers have different sizes based on OS.

Printing of an integers representation as either binary, octal, and hexadecimal
are also possible.

* Floating Point Types
Floating point types store approximations of real numbers.
Precision refers to how accurate a floating point number is.

- *float* single precision
- *double* double precision
- *long double* extended precision

Single precision usually means 4 bytes of precision, while double is 8 bytes.

#+begin_src cpp
  float a = 0.1F;
  double b = 0.2;
  long double c = 0.3L;
  double plancks_constant = 6.62607004e-34;
#+end_src

Using *%f* will display a float with decimal digits, whereas %e displays
the same number in scientific notation.

#+begin_src cpp
  #include <cstdio>
  int main() {
      double an = 6.0221409e23;
      printf("Avogadro's Number %le %lf %lg \n", an, an, an);
      float hp = 9.75;
      printf("Hogwart's Platform: %e %f %g \n", hp, hp, hp);
  }

#+end_src

* Character Types
- *char* The default type. Always 1 byte. May or may not be signed.
- *char16_t* Used for 2-byte character sets (UTF-16).
- *char32_t* Used for 4-byte character sets (UTF-32).
- *signed char* Same as char but always signed.
- *unsigned char* Same as char but always unsigned.

** Escape Sequences
| value           | escape sequences |
|-----------------+------------------|
| Newline         | \n               |
| Tab(Horizontal) | \t               |
| Tab(Vertical)   | \v               |
| Backspace       | \b               |
| Carriage Return | \r               |
| Form Feed       | \f               |
| Alert           | \a               |
| Backlash        | \\               |
| Question Mark   | ? or \?          |
| Single Quote    | \'               |
| Double Quote    | \"               |
| Null            | \0               |

* std::byte Type

System programmers sometimes work directly with /raw memory/ which is a collection
of bits without a type. Use the std::byte type which is found in /<cstdio>/.
