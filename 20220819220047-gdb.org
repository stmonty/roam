* GDB - Overview

An example of calling gdb on a C++ program.

#+BEGIN_SRC eshell
  Welcome to the Emacs shell

  ~/roam $ g++- main.cpp -o stepfun -g
  ~/roam $ gdb stepfun
#+END_SRC

Once in gdb, this will insert a breakpoint at line 5 of main.cpp:
#+begin_src
  (gdb) break main.cpp:5
#+end_src

This will break at the function called 'main' and run the program:
#+begin_src
  (gdb) break main
  (gdb) run
#+end_src

You can use the *step* command to to step by one instruction. Note that
this will step into functions.
You can use *finish* to step out of the function invocation.
You can also use *next* to move down an instruction without going into a function.

Inspect the current value of variables by using *info locals*.

To continue execution to the next breakpoint use *continue*.

* List of Useful Commands:

- run
- info locals
- continue
- step
- next
- break <file/linenum or function>
