#+title: twos-complement

* Overview
Convert a positive binary number into a negative binary number with the same
value. (5 -> -5)

** The Process
Take the signed binary representation of the number:

5 -> (0101)

Note that it needs the extra bit to represent the sign,

Invert the bits:

(0101) -> (1010)

And add 1:

(1010) -> (1011)

This will return the Two's Complement: -5.
